    Add compatibility with netty 3.2.0+.
    
    Netty 3.2.0+ (NETTY-281) changed HttpMessage.setHeader(String, String) to
    setHeader(String, Object), which causes NoSuchMethodErrors when spymemcached is
    used with such a newer netty version. To prevent spymemcached users from other
    library incompatibilities the netty dependency is not upgraded, but the
    appropriate setHeader method is selected and invoked at runtime. This was
    discussed on the mailing list:

    SPY-37 & SPY-38: Fixed redistribution performance issue
    
    This issue was caused by a O(n^3) algorithm used when redistributing
    operations among nodes. It turns out that one of the loops was not
    necessary because the clone operation is guaranteed to return a
    list of single key operations. Multi-key operations are never
    returned as part of this list.
    
    The fix involves removing the one of these loops. which frequently
    queued duplicate operations for transmission. Since the
    operations are all single key, the list returned by the call
    getKeys() is guaranteed to have only one operation.

    This variable should have never been an int since it is defined in

    Send an ack for all tap opaque messages
    
    Previously we ignored tap opaque and no-op messages. This caused
    us to hang tap streams in some cases. One example is when doing a
    tap dump. The server would send an opaque message and wait for an
    ack after transmitting all of the data. Since we ignored the opaque
    message the server would wait for an ack that would never be sent.
    This would cause the connection to hang.

    Change getBytes() to getData() in CASOperation
    
    The getBytes function was incorrectly named in the CASOperation
    class for two reasons. First the function actually gets the
    data field from a message so getData() is a better name. Second,
    in the StoreOperation class and other classes the name of the
    function is getData() so this improves consistency. This issue
    was notice when I was looking at the StoreOperation and saw that
    this class had two different functions that did exactly the same
    thing.

    Fix concurrent access to operations objects, especially near timeouts
    
    We discovered that having one thread call get() on futures with a
    timeout much shorter than the timeout built into the client could
    (after a while) reliably kill off the IO thread with a
    NullPointerException. After restarting with assertions enabled, we
    found many other ways to make the IO thread die relating mostly to
    operations that were canceled or timed out in one thread while they
    were being used in another thread.
    
    The solution to this is to make "timing out" an operation something
    similar to "cancel" - that is, not a state of the operation's state
    machine, but just a flag. Then, since this flag (as with the cancelled
    flag) can be read and set from multiple threads, synchronize the
    methods that do that.
    
    Ideally, transitionState and getState would never be called outside
    the IO thread; however, since at least getState is currently, both
    getState and transitionState should then also be synchronized.
    
    With these changes, we don't end up killing off the IO thread anymore.

    Improved performance of write queue processing during timeouts
    
    There were two major issues here. First if there are a lot of
    timeouts in a row then we processing the write queue we removed
    them only one at a time. We now are able to process the entire
    write queue each time the handleIO function is called. The
    second issue was that it is possible to send timed out requests
    to the server. This would happen if there was one not timed out
    request followed by some timed out requests. Since in the while
    loop we don't check to see if an operation is timed out (or
    cancelled) we would send it anyways. This commit addresses both
    of these issues by adding a getNextWritable() op which only
    operations that should be written. If the write queue is empty
    it returns null.

    Operations can't timeout when writing to the write buffer.
    
    We implemented a mechanism for operations to be able to timeout
    while waiting to be written to a socket, but failed to take into
    account the fact that an item can timeout while in the middle
    of writing to that buffer.
    
    This commit adds a new OperationState called WRITE_QUEUED that
    specifies that the operation is waiting to be written to the
    write buffer. When an operation begins writing to the write
    buffer it goes into the WRITING state. When an operation is in
    the WRITING state it cannot time out

    Log warnings when retrying due to not my vbucket.
    
    The existing behavior with not my vbucket errors prior to this
    change would warn when it receives an error to the log, but it
    would not followup that warning with any indication of what it
    did with the operation.  This can cause confusion end users
    are logging what's happening, so give the logging some symmetry
    by logging any retries due to not-my-vbucket.

    Ensure nodesMap updates are safe when topology changes.
    
    This change much more closely (perhaps too defensively)
    couples the Config and the list of nodes.  It also ensures
    that the Map<String, MemcachedNode> is less prone to
    concurrency problems and fixes a concurrency problem which
    allowed nodes to be removed when receiving a not-my-vbucket
    response.
    
    This indicates we need to make some changes to how the entire
    object model and config list are handled, but just to quickly
    fix a race found, tie together the config and node list when
    locating the right node.
    
    Testing for this is rather manual at the moment.

    Encode with commons codec more correctly.
    
    Apache Commons Codec had introduced a change in 1.4 that had it
    inadvertantly adding extra CRLF to encode responses.  We had worked
    around this issue when writing the initial HTTP authorization
    code, but it turns out commons codec has reverted to the behavior
    in 1.3 with the release of 1.5.
    
    For more info, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CODEC-89
    
    This change updates commons codec, adds a test to verify correct
    behavior, and addresses potential error handling issues with the
    character set.

    Tap streams now pause every 10,000 messages.
    
    In the previous code I was sending acks back to the server
    immediately and this kind of behavior could cause a heap overflow
    for users who start tap streams but don't process the messages. Now
    the ack messages are queued with the responses and only sent back
    to the server after all mutations sent before the ack was recieved
    are processed.

    Issue 96: ClassPathException fix
    
    The issue here was that we were combinding multiple types of
    get operations in the same class, but each operation would
    have a different Callback type. When we would go to optimize
    get operations it would optimize get, getl, gat, and gets
    operations and since they have different callback types we
    would throw an exception.
    
    Each operation now has its own class.

    Refactored Operations to improve correctness of vbucket aware ops
    
    Previously we had operations that implemented classes that they
    should not have been implemented. For example, there were ASCII
    operations that implementing the VBucketAware interface. Since
    ASCII operations must go through moxi and don't contain vbucket
    numbers there is no reason for them to implement this interface.
    
    This commit also contains the addition of SingleKeyOperationImpl
    and MultiKeyOperationImpl which subclass OperationImpl and are
    superclasses to binary operations that contain one or more keys
    correspondingly. This abstraction allows these type of operations
    to deal with vBucket awareness and the amount of keys the operation
    contains in different ways.

    Changed the value size of items used in LongClientTest
    
    The 32k value used previously worked fine when we were only testing
    clients against localhost, but in the future we want to be able to
    test spymemcached against servers on the network. This high value
    along with the large number of multi-gets done in this test causes
    failures due to not being able to read and write data fast enough.
    As a result timeouts were caused.
    
    The value has been lowered to something more reasonable for now, but
    in the future we should devise a test that will be able to test spy's
    ability to handle multi-gets with large values over a network.

    and then check to see whether or not they succeeded. They can also
    now access the error message that the server sends back to them
    so they can see why the server rejected their request. Operation
    status's also take into account operation timeouts and exceptions
    so if an operation times out the operation says so. Also if an
    exception is thrown while processing the operation the operation
    status reports the message from that exception.

    Change client ctor to detect vbucket usage from server.
    
    The question about whether or not to use vbuckets is really a
    funciton of the type of configuration the server will hand out.
    There should be no reason to give a URI, bucket name and whether
    or not it's vbucket capable.  That should be discernable from the
    configuration supplied by the server.
    
    This is believed to be compatible with how moxi detects cache
    buckets from membase buckets.

    The current way of handling this error is to reconnect, but this
    is no the correct way to handle a this error since the server will

    There are other commands that should handle this as well, but right
    now I am only submitting a fix for the set operation since this is
    the operration that causes this error most frequently. We plan on

    Increase the maximum size allowed.  Issue 106.
    
    Though memcached still has a 1MiB size by default (overridable
    with a flag), other engines may have their own maximum.  Membase
    for instance has a 20MiB maximum.
    
    Note that the size enforced by the transcoder can be overridden
    through it's ctor.  The reason for making this change is to
    create a new, larger default.
    
    At least for the remainder of the 2.6 series, rather than do
    deep surgery on this issue, just bump up the maximum.

    Search more with the KetamaIterator.
    
    The existing KetamaIterator implementation, with a small number
    of nodes, may actually hit the same down node multiple times in
    a row leading to failing to find a node when it should find
    another one.
    
    The original libketama[1] hashes each server to 160 numeric
    values.  These are spread out in a 64-bit value.  The key is
    then hashed to a numeric value within that 64-bit value and
    walked forward until it finds a server.
    
    Previously, this library's ketama implementation would only look
    in the consistent hash for a number of iterations limited by the
    number of servers.  With two servers (similar to flipping a
    coin, you'd get heads twice in a row sometimes) you would have
    a 1 in 4 chance of picking the same dead server twice.
    
    The new implementation will iterate based on the number of
    servers, but attempts to keep the probability of hitting the
    same dead server to less than 1% for a two node configuration.
    This will guarantee less than 1% possibility with two or more
    servers.
    
    Because we iterate by simply appending the number of tries on
    the front of the key, we'll be quite random about where in
    the continuium we hit.  Each selection is rather random, but
    for a set of results already calculated, half of which are
    alive and half of which are dead, we can say that in seven
    iterations, there is only a 1/128 [1/(2^7)] chance that we
    would not select once at least one alive server.  The
    probability for any given test still 1/2, but we can describe
    the probability of the iterations.  The key info on this came
    from the "gambler's fallacy"[2].

    Some future implementations may want to have dynamic changes to
    the nodes list, so the KetamaIterator has been refactored to its
    own class so it can be replaced while a client is instantiated.

    Fixes to testSyncGetTimeouts.
    
    Previous to enforcing the timeouts at an operation level, this test
    would pass.  In fact, Dustin said the test had never failed before.
    
    However, it turns out that the really short default timeouts would
    be too short and not waiting a bit after encountering a timeout would
    still see timeouts.

    Add a TIMEDOUT state to ops and make callbacks correct.
    
    There would be some situations where the latch would not expire
    due to the callback not having been called.  Callbacks were
    typically called on state transition for the operation, so I
    thought it appropriate to add a TIMEDOUT state.

    Recognize operation may be null at times.  e.g.: flush
    
    Both the timeout changes from myself and some of the continuious timeout
    changes from Boris assumed there would always be an operation.  In
    some cases, like flush, that is not necessarily the case.
    
    Looking at the existing code, there were lots of guards against null
    access already, so I just continued that tradition.
    
    The tradition may need to be broken though in the future.

    Increased default timeout to 2500ms.
    
    The increase of the timeout to this seemingly high value is due to
    a few findings.
    
    First, by default, garbage collection times may easily go over 1sec.
    Testing with simple toy tests shows this quite clearly, even on
    systems with lots of CPUs and a decent amount of memory.  Of course,
    much of this can be controlled with GC tuning on the JVM.  With the
    hotspot JVM, look to this whitepaper:
    http://java.sun.com/j2se/reference/whitepapers/memorymanagement_whitepaper.pdf
    
    Testing showed the following to be particularly useful:
    -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=850
    
    There is a CPU time tradeoff for this.
    
    Even with these, testing showed some 1 second timeouts when GCs near a
    half a second.  To use this software though, we shouldn't expect people
    to have to tune the GC, so raising the default seems like the
    right thing to do.
    
    Second, many systems use spymemcached on virtualized or cloud environments.
    The processes running there do not have any guarantee of execution
    time.  It'd be really unlikely for a thread to be starved for more than
    a second, but it is possible and shouldn't make things stop.  Raising this
    a bit will help.
    
    Third, and perhaps most importantly, most people run applications on
    networks that do not offer any guarantee around response time.  If
    the network is oversubscribed or even minor blips occur on the network
    can cause TCP retransmissions.  While many TCP implementations ignore
    it, RFC 2988 specifies rounding up to 1sec when calculating
    TCP retransmit timeouts.  Blips will occur, and rather than force
    this seemingly synchronous get to timeout, it may be better to
    just wait a bit longer by default.

    Do not write timedout operations to the MemcachedNode.
    
    This commit and related ones add support to an operation to
    have new methods and a state of TIMEDOUT.  The intent is to
    keep track of when an operation is created and if it either
    times out due to a latch timeout expiration or it is found
    to be already too old when thinking about sending the op
    to the network, just consider it timed out then and there.
    
    Note, object creation time is actually possibly quite a bit
    after when the request is made, depending on how that request
    is made.  Any number of things could have happened in
    between with GC, JIT, scheduling, etc.
    
    Also note that in order to avoid needing to rely on the latch
    which is in a different thread, this allows us to keep track
    of the creation time of the operation and check for whether or
    not it has timed out via the isTimedOut() method on the
    operation.
    
    Doing this correctly and with as little API change as possible
    required getting the default operation timeout down to the
    MemcachedNode level.  That information was not previously known
    to the Operation or the node, but simply relied on a latch.

    creating an array or list of identical transcoders, other

    plug potential file descriptor leak
    
    There is a problem in open/connect sequence that may produce
    file descriptor leaks in some abnormal conditions:
    First, SocketChannel.open() is called,
    then ch.connect(a.getSocketAddress())
    is called and it may throw an IOException under certain conditions.
    Then we catch exception and re-queue the node.
    This will produce a leak since the channel was not closed.
    
    The problem surfaced because of some faulty changes that I made
    and which I fixed. But it's nevertheless a problem.
    
    Sun  bug reference. http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6548464
    They fixed it in a helper method that opens/connects in a single call.
    But in our case the client needs to take care of it.
    
    One more small unrelated change is to
    catch an unchecked exception and log an error:
    it is a serious case because the node
    will be essentially lost and never re-queued.

    Don't use methods and enum's that only exist in JDK 1.6.
    
    The changes successfully compile and the unit tests pass with JDK 1.6,
    but with 1.5 I consistently get a unit test failure here:

    Handle auth failures more gracefully; maximum failures.
    
    This change will ensure that autentication failures do not
    hang the thread adding an operation.  The default behavior
    is to try to authenticate forever and whine to the log if
    authentication continues to fail.
    
    Optionally, a developer may define
    net.spy.memcached.auth.AuthThreshold with an integer value
    to set a maximum number of authentication attempts before
    shutting down.
    
    Authentication threads are now spawned and managed by an
    AuthTreadMonitor class, ensuring that for any given
    connection there can only be one outstanding AuthThread.

    Enhance MemcachedNode to know whether auth should happen.
    
    When SASL authentication is requested of a MemcachedClient it should
    always ensure that auth takes place before anything else on the queue
    is processed.
    
    After some experimentation, it seems The best way to handle this is to
    extend the MemcachedNode interface to add some methods. This in turn
    allows for the changes to be implemented in the TCPMemcachedNodeImpl
    class.
    
    There is special handling with the inputQueue and addOperation if
    a reconnect occurs during authentication.
    
    It's a bit harder at the BinaryMemcachedNodeImpl, though arguably
    makes more sense there.  Since these are all pretty well hidden as an
    implementation detail, it's okay for it to be here.
    
    Who knows, maybe someday ascii will have SASL.  Probably not though.

    New TCP connection timeout feature; if server fails completely, d/c.
    
    With this change, the MemcachedClient has a method of using the
    connection observer to determine a connected server is consistently
    timing out, indicating it has hard-failed.  This will destroy that
    connection so things may rehash or reconnect, depending on the hash
    behavior.

    I don't think it'd be a change between Java 1.5 and Java 6, but in any

    incorporated in the diff in the comments here.  Since binary protocol
    is a feature, I thought this was a good place to show it off too.

    Especially in bulk cases, the server can be transmitting data from an
    operation and receiving results from it simultaneously.  It's no
    longer sufficient to consider an operation to be either reading or
    writing, but it's likely that it will need to read at the very moment
    it begins writing.

    It looks like the 2.4.1 client resolves this by catching
    ConnectException and queuing a reconnect, in this code:
    
    // Initially I had attempted to skirt this by queueing every
    // connect, but it considerably slowed down start time.
    try {
    	if(ch.connect(sa)) {
    		getLogger().info("Connected to %s immediately", qa);
    		connected(qa);
    	} else {
    		getLogger().info("Added %s to connect queue", qa);
    		ops=SelectionKey.OP_CONNECT;
    	}
    	qa.setSk(ch.register(selector, ops, qa));
    	assert ch.isConnected()
    		|| qa.getSk().interestOps() == SelectionKey.OP_CONNECT
    		: "Not connected, and not wanting to connect";
    } catch(ConnectException e) {
    	queueReconnect(qa);
    }
    connections.add(qa);
    
    Given the stack trace I observed, the catch of ConnectException should
    cast a slightly larger net and catch SocketException.

    Fixed bug in sequence number wrapping (bug90).
    
    If the cas op on seqNumber fails, rv never gets updated and will loop
    until seqNumber wraps at least one more time. proposed fix increments
    seqNumber whether or not the cas succeeds: if another thread was able
    to swap to 0 before we were, we're still good to go.

    Optimize binary protocol sets.
    
    This optimization works in a similar fashion to the GET optimization,
    but is binary protocol specific.  Effectively, all mutation operations
    are folded into quiet ops and the responses are dispatched as implied
    positives when the operations are known to have finished.

    A Map interface to memcached.
    
    This obviously has limitations -- specifically around attempts to
    iterate the cache.  Any place where a Map is used as a cache, this
    should make a nice swap-in replacement, though.

    Removed setTranscoder from client.
    
    This was not thread safe and shouldn't generally be done.  You can
    pass in a transcoder on a given operation, but attempting to change

    Handle multi-get dispatch fanning out into individual gets.
    
    This covers the case of a multi-get targeting a downed server, getting
    pulled out and redistributed individually to a bunch of individual
    operations on other servers.
    
    Note that this is (should be):
    
     1) Rare (you don't have servers dying a lot, do you?
     2) Later optimized into per-server multi-gets when prepped for the wire.

    Beginning of the redistribute failure strategy.
    
    This changed the default strategy used throughout tests since the new
    strategy is not complete and prematurely cancels all operations
    destined for the broken server.

    Split up commands into Keyed and other operations.
    
    KeyedOperations lets us know for which operations we know the original
    keys so we can do things like find another server to play the
    operations against.

    Converted to an unbounded LinkedBlockingQueue for internal queues.
    
    The external queue is still bounded, but the internal queues won't
    overflow by default (at the cost of more memory during spikes).

    I'm thinking about changing internal queue types, and would like the
    test to still be able to overrun.

    Added the ability to pass in initial observers at construct time.
    
    With this, observers can observe the *initial* connection, which (as
    the test demonstrates) can allow a caller to block until all (or at
    least enough) connections are established before proceeding.

    Asynchronous incr/decr with no default.
    
    Theoretically, this can work with default values as well, but only in
    the binary protocol.  Getting this to work with the text protocol
    would likely be quite painful.

    Handle fast-failure on an attempted reconnect.
    
    http://code.google.com/p/spymemcached/issues/detail?id=31

commit e5ebc572775fb7c197381fc5e3d8ffaab3540a9a
Author: Dustin Sallings <dustin@spy.net>
Date:   Thu Oct 2 21:22:11 2008 -0700

    If we attempt to read when we don't have anything to read, reconnect.
    
    This seems to happen in some strange server-error cases where the
    server short-circuits the connection.  This situation has shown itself
    when we've sent something too large into the server.  Precautions have
    been taken to prevent that exact thing from happening again, but this
    is a better way to handle an unexpected state.
    
    I'm not sure how we end up still having data to receive when we've
    already thrown away the ops, but tearing down the connection is a
    clean way to recover from a bad state.

    Throw an exception if we attempt to store data we know is too big.
    
    This will avoid a few problems people have encountered.  I implemented
    it with a somewhat early IllegalArgumentException because it was the
    surest way to cover every case given compression and several paths in
    to sets.

    Decode async bulk gets outside of the IO thread.
    
    The same work still needs to happen for one-off gets, but this should
    help allow the IO thread to focus on IO while consumer threads
    distribute the more CPU-intensive work.

    More consistent hash proving.

    Killed off a slightly elusive bug that was causing sporatic cancellations.
    
    Whenever a read returned in the binary protocol without having read
    enough bytes to fill a header packet, an NPE would be fired that would
    cause us to disconnect from the server and cancel all in-flight
    operations.
    
    This happened occasionally in one of my tests and was rather a pain to
    track down.  It likely never affected anyone since I doubt anyone is
    actually using the binary protocol anywhere today.

    Allow the input, op read and op write queues to be individually specified.
    
    By default, the read queue is 10% larger than the input queue.
    
    With a sufficiently large op read queue, it's possible to never
    internally overflow, but correct values are likely
    application-specific.

    Read before writes and expect IllegalStateException.
    
    These are two measures that are helping with the queue overflow
    problems.
    
    Firstly, the IllegalStateException is thrown whenever you attempted to
    add to a queue that's full.  If that happens internally, I don't want
    the IO thread to crash, so I add it to the normal ``expected
    exceptions'' list.
    
    Secondly, reading before writing helps keep the read buffer ready for
    new data.  When writing first, the write will have to transition to a
    read and may cause the read buffer to overflow.  It still may happen,
    but by servicing the reads first I can at least get the complete ones
    popped out before piling new ones in (since writes are almost always
    smaller and likely to transition).

    Turning the timeouts way up during tests.
    
    I manage to do something that slows stuff down in my full test plan
    which leads to spurious failures.
    
    This may be hinting at a bug of some type, or perhaps some bad
    defaults, but this code isn't attempting to test timeouts so they
    should never get in the way.

    Test fix.  Invalid connections shouldn't fail to shut down.
    
    I think there may be a bigger bug around this, but it only occurs when
    trying to shut down a connection that shouldn't've started due to
    someone writing a broken connection factory, so I think we can live
    with it.

Date:   Fri May 2 19:54:20 2008 -0700

    Moved operation timeout into the connection factory.
    
    It shouldn't change at runtime in a client, as the current model was
    not thread safe.  In order for this to be dynamically reconfigurable,
    the field either needs to be volatile or access to the value must be
    synchronized.
    
    By having the value be declared final and removing the mutators and
    accessors, we can guarantee correctness.

    Make CASValue parameterized in T.  Do this by requiring a Transcoder
    argument for CASMutator's contrustor.  This removes the need for casts
    In CASMutator.  Use the new LongTranscoder in the test suite.

    Move the encode*() and decode*() methods in SerializingTranscoder.java

Date:   Tue Mar 4 14:52:25 2008 -0800

    Move Transcoder and SerializingTranscoder into a new
    net.spy.memcached.transcoders package.  This gives space to write
    transcoders for many native types, which will allow for compile-time
    checks.

Date:   Tue Mar 4 14:07:28 2008 -0800

    Add parameterized versions of all the MemcachedClient methods.
    
    The new methods all take a Transcoder<T> and if they returned an
    Object, now return a T instead.
    
    The non-paramterized methods use the SerializingTranscoder which
    has T as an Object and calls the parameterized ones, so callers
    should not see a change in behavior.

    Change the Transcoder interface to be parameterized by the type of objects
    it serializes.  This will allow for custom Transcoders to be used in
    methods and stronger compile-time warnings.
    
    The default SerializingTranscoder implements Transcoder<Object>.

    Slightly cleaner shutdown sequence.
    
    This avoids a couple of the exceptions that were occuring on shutdown
    due to lack of coordination (just allowing the NIO exceptions to tear
    stuff down), and downgrades others to debug as we can expect things to
    error occasionally when the plug is pulled.

    Use an enum instead of a boolean to indicate what happened during a CAS.
    
    There are two normal failure states which must be distinguished.  An enum
    will indicate success vs. one of the failure states.

    Use a constant for the command implementing base get in the text protocol.
    
    This change is slight, but it seems a little better to use the constant to set
    a final than to use an abstract method to get the constant.

    	Fixed a bug related to detecting timeouts of CountDownLatches.
    
    	Prior to 65ea6e61fdc2 (when I replaced my own mechanism with
    CountDownLatch), exceptions were thrown by the latch mechanism.
    
    	CountDownLatch requires you to check a return value to determine whether
    there was a timeout or the count went all the way down.
    
    	Tests were added to ensure the correctness of this behavior on all async
    calls.

    	Pulled QueueAttachment out into MemcachedNode.
    
    	QueueAttachment was a nested class in MemcachedConnection that was used to
    hold per-connection information.  It was called QueueAttachment because it was
    attached to the select queue or something like that.  MemcachedNode seems like
    a better name, and it's going to need to be exposed some as we get into more
    pluggable node selection algorithms.

Author: Dustin Sallings <dustin@spy.net>
Date:   Fri Jun 29 01:24:06 2007 -0700

    	Some changes to get this bench thing to run under the profiler.
    
    	There were a couple of stupidities in how the client was set up, and some
    issues keeping large numbers of async sets down.  It still doesn't model a real
    application very well, but may be good enough at showing what would happen in a
    peak situation.

commit 63215d8b3a2bd4083c8c22a2a1c6da82c74e0bb8
Author: Dustin Sallings <dustin@spy.net>
Date:   Fri Jun 29 00:08:59 2007 -0700

    	Support for working around a failing server.
    
    	Apparently, the common thing to do is check the status of a server when
    performing a command against it, and trying the next server in the list when
    the server is unavailable.
    
    	My previous behavior was to queue a command against a server regardless of
    its status such that when a server was available the command would be processed
    as close to immediately as contention would allow, but when a server was
    unavailable, the command would wait around for the server to come back up.
    
    	The new behavior is something near the middle of this.  When a server is
    unavailable, I'll try the next server in the list.  I repeat until I've
    exhausted every known server and then just queue it for the one to which it
    belonged in the first place.

    	Trying to arrange buffers for writes before sending them.
    
    	This is broken right now since copying one buffer into another without

    	This may conflict with get optimization.

Date:   Mon Apr 2 12:53:20 2007 -0700

    	Unit tests centered around an actual memcached plus a couple bug fixes this
    found.
    
    	I really don't like having unit tests rely on network resources, but a
    dedicated memcached on localhost is obviously better than not having one at all
    (based on my unit tests).  I still don't have a way to model the various
    failure modes I have code to support, though.

    	When we receive data when we're not expecting to do so, log what we
    receive.
    
    	This revealed a strange condition where a server gave us an error while we
    were transmitting data.  I don't know exactly what caused this error
    (SERVER_ERROR object too large for cache).  I'm feeding it what I think is my
    largest object, but it doesn't break.  Will have to experiment more.
